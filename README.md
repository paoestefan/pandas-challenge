Pandas homework for 

What a challenge. I noticed that pandas is easier to be used but is not a really good platform for styling without afecting in the number characteristics. 
I achieve to give some format to the numbers but I struggled with the last one as if I format it as a currency it could not be arrange in descending order
Also I could not understand what I was supposed to do in the "Avg Total Purchase per Person". 
Also I understood better how to make a markdown in jupyter notebook as I did there the 3 observations they ask in the homework.
